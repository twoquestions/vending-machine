# Vending Machine

Simulates a small coin-only vending machine.

## Coin Acceptor

Accepts valid coins, and puts them into the proper bin, puts invalid
coins into the coin return.

## Product Dispenser

If we have enough money in the machine, when we push a button for
a specific product it will be dispensed.  Also it will give 
out proper change instead of keeping the money.
