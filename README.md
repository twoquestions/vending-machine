# Vending Machine

Simulates a small coin-only vending machine.

## Coin Acceptor

Accepts valid coins, and puts them into the proper bin, puts invalid
coins into the coin return.

## Product Dispenser

If we have enough money in the machine, when we push a button for
a specific product it will be dispensed.  Also it will give 
out proper change instead of keeping the money.
The vending machine will also give you money back if you push
the coin return without picking anything.
